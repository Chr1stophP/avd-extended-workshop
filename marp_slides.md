# What is NOT covered in this Workshop?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- This workshop is not a deep dive into each and every topic. It is covering some advanced concepts, but you may need additional documentation and training to understand every topic in details.  
  For additional information please refer to the following resources:
  - [Ansible AVD Documentation](https://avd.arista.com/)
  - [VSCode Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

`Section 1.2`

> - How to get your lab environment up and running

---

# How to use this Workshop?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 24px;}</style>

- To try all practical examples you need to have access to the lab environment. There are 3 possible options:
  - Use Github Codespaces. This is the preferred option, but double check that you understand all the costs and free tier limits.
  - Use Arista Test Drive - Single DC topology. Please ask your Arista SE to create an ATD lab for you.
  - Build your own lab environment: Ubuntu LTS + Docker + ContainerLab. This option is not described in detail, but the devcontainer used to build Codespaces environment will work on any machine with Docker installed. Please contact your SE if you need help.

---

# Lab Topology

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- This workshop is using Arista Test Drive Single DC topology.
- To match minimize resources and fit default Codespaces 4-core machine, the topology was reduced by removing leaf3, leaf4, host1 and host2.
- Feel free to adjust Ansible inventory and group variables if you are using ATD lab and would prefer to activate them all. But it's not essential for this workshop.
- CVP is not used as it's not required for this workshop.

# Ansible Installation Warnings

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right](img/pexels-danne-555709.jpg)

- Double check that the path to Ansible collection is correct. Normally it is expected to be in `/home/coder/.ansible/`
- You `PATH` environment variable must be set correctly!
- Never install Ansible as root user!
- Watch out for environments with a long history, conflicting Python installations etc.
- Containers make it simple! Use containers! üê≥
  > The Codespaces environment is based on a container with all requirements installed.

# Before You Create Codespaces Environment

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/github-billing.png)

- Codespaces is a paid feature. Please check [Github Codespaces pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)
- It has a free tier for personal accounts:
  - 120 core-hours per month -> will be 30 hours on a 4-core machine
  - 15 GB storage per month -> this will be a bottleneck for the workshop container image
- The free tier is enough to complete this workshop, but don't forget to delete the Codespaces environment after the workshop.
- Check `your account > Settings > Billing and plans > Spending limits` to make sure that if you exceed the limit, there will be no charges. The default limit of `0.00` will avoid any extra expenses.

---

# Start a Codespace

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right](img/start-codespaces.jpg)

- Click `Code` button in the top right corner of the Github page.
- Click `Create codespace on main` button.
- Wait until the codespace environment is created.
- Once codespace container is ready the VSCode will open automatically in your browser.

> WARNING‚ùï:
>
> - Check `paid for by` field and make sure that you are using your personal account. If you are using a company account, you may be charged for the Codespaces usage. Also double-check previous slide and make sure that you understand the costs and limits.
> - Do not use pre-builds. They consume storage across regions and can quickly exceed the free tier limit.

---

# Open Existing Codespace

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/codespaces-open-in.jpg)

- Once the Codespace is created, you can open it again by clicking `Code` button in the top right corner of the Github page and clicking 3 dots next to codespace name.
- Alternatively you can open it from the [Github Codespaces page](https://github.com/codespaces)
- If you have VSCode installed locally, pick `Open in Visual Studio Code` option. Otherwise use `Open in browser` option. The codespace container will always run remotely.

> WARNING‚ùï: Do not forget to delete the Codespace after the workshop.

# Use The Local VSCode and Dev Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/architecture-containers.png)

- It's possible to run exactly the same container locally on a machine with Docker installed and use local VSCode Remote Containers feature to connect to it.
- Obviously there are no charges for this option. It's completely free, except the electricity bill.
- It is not covered in this workshop for one single reason: there are too many different environments and it's impossible to cover them all.
- Check [VSCode Dev Containers documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for details.

# Useful eAPI Troubleshooting Trick

If you are facing any issues when to push configs or collect any data using eAPI, test access with the following command:

```bash
curl --user <login>:<password> --data "show version" --insecure https://<switch-mgmt-ip>:443/command-api --verbose
```

Try it now! üî®
With `--verbose` it can tell you a lot.

# Change Underlay Routing Protocol to OSPF

- Go to `avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_FABRIC.yml` and uncomment following line:

  ```yaml
  underlay_routing_protocol: ospf
  ```

- Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml` to generate new configs.
- Click `Source Control` icon on the left panel and check the diffs.
- Commit you change with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional): Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-provision-eapi.yml` to push the new configs to the lab switches.

<div class="columns">
<div>

- The `Tenant` in AVD is an abstraction combining a set of VRFs, VLANs and SVIs to be created on a set of switches.
- Open `avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_TENANTS_NETWORKS.yml` and uncomment the lines related to `Tenant_B`
- Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml` to generate new configs.
- This will generate required EVPN configs for the new VRF, VLANs and SVIs.
- Click `Source Control` icon on the left panel and check the diffs.
- Commit you change with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional): Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-provision-eapi.yml` to push the new configs to the lab switches.

# Filter VLANs Deployed

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- Currently all VLANs listed in `AVD_TENANTS_NETWORKS.yml` are deployed on the switches even if there are no client-facing interfaces configured for those VLANs.
- To filter out unused VLANs, open `avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_FABRIC.yml` and uncomment the following line:

  ```yaml
  l3leaf:
    defaults:
      # ... other defaults
      # keep all the lines above unchanged
      # ...
      filter:
        only_vlans_in_use: true
  ```

- Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml` to generate new configs.
- Click `Source Control` icon on the left panel and check the diffs.
- Commit you change with a meaningful commit message.
- (Optional): Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-provision-eapi.yml` to push the new configs to the lab switches.

<style scoped>code {font-size: 14px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

- Currently ports to `host1` are configured as access ports in VLAN110.
- Let's change that to a trunk with VLANs 110 and 160 allowed.
- Open `avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_SERVERS.yml` and add a new port profile. The change is shown on the right.
- Run `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml` to generate new configs.
- Click `Source Control` icon on the left panel and check the diffs.
- Commit you change with a meaningful commit message.

# Validate The Network

<style scoped>section {font-size: 24px;}</style>

- To confirm that network state is correct use AVD network validation role.
- 1st, make sure that you have generated the latest configs and pushed them to the switches:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml
  ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-provision-eapi.yml
  ```

- Run the following command to validate the network state:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-validate-state.yml
  ```

- The validate role has some limitations that are quite critical when building a CI pipeline. But there is some work in progress. For example, check [ANTA library](https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/anta) for an alternative solution.

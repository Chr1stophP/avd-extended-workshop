# What is Git?

![bg right fit](img/Git-Logo-1788C.png)

- **In Short**:
  > Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to a set of files and enables collaborative work.
- **Fun Fact**:
  > [Git was created](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git) by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux kernel.

---

# What is GitHub?

![bg right fit](img/github-mark-white.png)

- GitHub is a Git repository hosting platform.
- Allows to coordinate multiple local copies of the same repository and more.

---

# VSCode

<style scoped>section {font-size: 24px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/code-stable.png)

- Visual Studio Code is an extensible source-code editor developed by Microsoft and free to use.
- This will be our main tool to work with Ansible AVD and interact with Git repositories in the workshop and production.
- We are not going to cover VSCode installation and customization in this workshop. Check [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) for details.

`Section 1.2`

> - How to get your lab environment up and running

---

# How to use this Workshop?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 24px;}</style>

- To try all practical examples you need to have access to the lab environment. There are 3 possible options:
  - Use Github Codespaces. This is the preferred option, but double check that you understand all the costs and free tier limits.
  - Use Arista Test Drive - Single DC topology. Please ask your Arista SE to create an ATD lab for you.
  - Build your own lab environment: Ubuntu LTS + Docker + ContainerLab. This option is not described in detail, but the devcontainer used to build Codespaces environment will work on any machine with Docker installed. Please contact your SE if you need help.

---

# Lab Topology

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- This workshop is using Arista Test Drive Single DC topology.
- To match minimize resources and fit default Codespaces 4-core machine, the topology was reduced by removing leaf3, leaf4, host1 and host2.
- Feel free to adjust Ansible inventory and group variables if you are using ATD lab and would prefer to activate them all. But it's not essential for this workshop.
- CVP is not used as it's not required for this workshop.

# Ansible Installation Warnings

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right](img/pexels-danne-555709.jpg)

- Double check that the path to Ansible collection is correct. Normally it is expected to be in `/home/coder/.ansible/`
- You `PATH` environment variable must be set correctly!
- Never install Ansible as root user!
- Watch out for environments with a long history, conflicting Python installations etc.
- Containers make it simple! Use containers! üê≥
  > The Codespaces environment is based on a container with all requirements installed.

---

# Setup Ansible AVD Repository

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

```bash
# 1. install yq to adjust AVD yaml files - https://github.com/mikefarah/yq
#    you can certainly edit yaml files manually, but there would be no fun üëé
export VERSION="v4.34.1" BINARY="yq_linux_amd64"
sudo wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/$VERSION/$BINARY -O /usr/bin/yq \
    && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/yq
# 2. Clone your copy of this repository
cd labfiles
git clone https://github.com/<gh-handle>/<your-copy-of-this-repository>.git avd-extended-workshop
# 3. switch to the repository directory
cd avd-extended-workshop
# 4. confirm that you are working with the `main` branch
#    if not, type following command to change the branch
git checkout main
#    you should see the following prompt
‚ûú  avd-extended-workshop git:(main)
# 5. update ansible.cfg to match ATD container user
cp extras/ansible-avd.cfg avd_inventory/ansible.cfg
# 6. set Ansible password to your AVD environment password
yq -i '.all.vars.ansible_password = "<your-password>"' avd_inventory/inventory.yml

# Before You Create Codespaces Environment

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/github-billing.png)

- Codespaces is a paid feature. Please check [Github Codespaces pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)
- It has a free tier for personal accounts:
  - 120 core-hours per month -> will be 30 hours on a 4-core machine
  - 15 GB storage per month -> this will be a bottleneck for the workshop container image
- The free tier is enough to complete this workshop, but don't forget to delete the Codespaces environment after the workshop.
- Check `your account > Settings > Billing and plans > Spending limits` to make sure that if you exceed the limit, there will be no charges. The default limit of `0.00` will avoid any extra expenses.

---

# Start a Codespace

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right](img/start-codespaces.jpg)

- Click `Code` button in the top right corner of the Github page.
- Click `Create codespace on main` button.
- Wait until the codespace environment is created.
- Once codespace container is ready the VSCode will open automatically in your browser.

> WARNING‚ùï:
>
> - Check `paid for by` field and make sure that you are using your personal account. If you are using a company account, you may be charged for the Codespaces usage. Also double-check previous slide and make sure that you understand the costs and limits.
> - Do not use pre-builds. They consume storage across regions and can quickly exceed the free tier limit.

---

# Open Existing Codespace

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/codespaces-open-in.jpg)

- Once the Codespace is created, you can open it again by clicking `Code` button in the top right corner of the Github page and clicking 3 dots next to codespace name.
- Alternatively you can open it from the [Github Codespaces page](https://github.com/codespaces)
- If you have VSCode installed locally, pick `Open in Visual Studio Code` option. Otherwise use `Open in browser` option. The codespace container will always run remotely.

> WARNING‚ùï: Do not forget to delete the Codespace after the workshop.

# Use The Local VSCode and Dev Container

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

![bg right fit](img/architecture-containers.png)

- It's possible to run exactly the same container locally on a machine with Docker installed and use local VSCode Remote Containers feature to connect to it.
- Obviously there are no charges for this option. It's completely free, except the electricity bill.
- It is not covered in this workshop for one single reason: there are too many different environments and it's impossible to cover them all.
- Check [VSCode Dev Containers documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for details.

# What is Ansible AVD?

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

- AVD stands for Arista Validated Design
- Documentation is available at [avd.arista.com](https://avd.arista.com/)
- Historically it is based on the [EVPN Deployment Guide](https://www.arista.com/custom_data/downloads/?f=/support/download/DesignGuides/EVPN_Deployment_Guide.pdf), but now it's much more advanced and developing fast.
- Ansible AVD repository is available here: [github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd)
- The Ansible AVD collection is relying on:
  - [EOS foundational modules](https://galaxy.ansible.com/arista/eos) maintained by RedHat: `ansible-galaxy collection install arista.eos`
  - [Ansible CVP modules](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-cvp) to interact with CloudVision Portal when required

# Typical Ansible AVD Automation Workflow

<style scoped>section {font-size: 22px;}</style>

<div class="columns">
<div>

- Collect user input from various data sources and aggregate in a single source of truth. For ex. git repository.
- Generate low level variables from abstracted input data using sophisticated fabric logic
- Parse Jinja2 templates to produce plain text configs
- Push plain text configs via CloudVision Portal as change-control "proxy" or directly to devices via eAPI.

# AVD Collection Structure

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- Ansible AVD consists of the following key roles:
  - `eos_designs` - an set of modules to produce low level variables from abstracted input data using sophisticated fabric logic
  - `eos_cli_config_gen` - generate Arista EOS cli configuration from a set of templates and variables produced by `eos_designs` role

# Useful eAPI Troubleshooting Trick

If you are facing any issues when to push configs or collect any data using eAPI, test access with the following command:

```bash
curl --user <login>:<password> --data "show version" --insecure https://<switch-mgmt-ip>:443/command-api --verbose
```

Try it now! üî®
With `--verbose` it can tell you a lot.

# Filter VLANs Deployed

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- Currently all VLANs listed in `AVD_TENANTS_NETWORKS.yml` are deployed on the switches even if there are no client-facing interfaces configured for those VLANs.
- To filter out unused VLANs, open `avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_FABRIC.yml` and uncomment the following line:

  ```yaml
  l3leaf:
    defaults:
      # ... other defaults
      # keep all the lines above unchanged
      # ...
      filter:
        only_vlans_in_use: true

# Validate The Network

<style scoped>section {font-size: 24px;}</style>

- To confirm that network state is correct use AVD network validation role.
- 1st, make sure that you have generated the latest configs and pushed them to the switches:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml
  ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-provision-eapi.yml
  ```

- Run the following command to validate the network state:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-validate-state.yml
  ```

- The validate role has some limitations that are quite critical when building a CI pipeline. But there is some work in progress. For example, check [ANTA library](https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/anta) for an alternative solution.

<div class="columns">
<div>

- YAML is a data serialization language.
- It is not the only one. There are many others: JSON, XML, TOML, INI, CSV etc.
- Purpose:
  > convert data to a machine-readable format that can be stored or transmitted.
- YAML is generally considered to be a human-readable format. Well, kind of. ü§ì But at least it's possible to add comments, which is not possible in JSON.
- YAML is the default format to write Ansible playbooks, inventory files and group/host variables.

The playbook used to generate configs for this workshop in YAML format:

```yaml

  gather_facts: false
  collections:
    - arista.avd

# YAML Linter

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- `Linter` is a tool that checks the code/document for errors, bugs, style violations etc.
- Install YAML-linter on your machine: `pip install --user yamllint`
- Create a minimalistic YAML file: `echo -n "key: value" > test.yaml`
- Run the linter to check errors:

```bash
vscode ‚ûú /workspaces/avd-extended-workshop (main) $ yamllint test.yaml
test.yaml
1:1       warning  missing document start "---"  (document-start)
1:11      error    no new line character at the end of file  (new-line-at-end-of-file)
```

- Congrats! üéâ We have two errors in a single line YAML. :upside_down_face:
- Linters are helpful! Always check your YAMLs with a CLI linter or VSCode/other IDE extension.

---

# Every YAML Starts with `---`

<style scoped>section {font-size: 20px;}</style>

- Absolutely every YAML file must start with `---` on the first line.
- YAMLs without `---` are not valid, but will be accepted by many tools in fact.
- Quote from [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/):
  > YAML uses three dashes (‚Äú---‚Äù) to separate directives from document content. This also serves to signal the start of a document if no directives are present. Three dots ( ‚Äú...‚Äù) indicate the end of a document without starting a new one, for use in communication channels.
- Another `---` in the same yaml file would indicate the start of a new document. It is not used in Ansible data structures normally.
- Every YAML file must end with an empty line.

  > There are many more rules in YAML that are rarely in use, but must be üíØ% respected.

---

# JSON vs YAML for Ansible

- Ansible can accept variables in JSON format as well.
- Convert a group var file to JSON with `yq`: `yq --prettyPrint -o=json avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_SERVERS.yml > avd_inventory/group_vars/ATD_SERVERS.json`
- Delete the YAML file and run the build playbook: `ansible-playbook playbooks/atd-fabric-build.yml`
- New configs will be generated successfully. JSON is faster, YAML is still easier to read and edit at scale.
